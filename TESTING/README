! --------------  LAPACK95/TESTING directory  -----------------------

   The directory contains testing files for all the routines, included
in the library (currently all the driver routines from LAPACK are
implemented) and for all four data types. The names follow the convention:
               la_test_<precision><routine_name>
The testing is modified LAPACK testing. To make the executable test files
you need to run the make command, followed by the name of the executable,
that you need, for example: 
                make linsingle
    or 
                make eigdcomplex
If you need all the executables you can do simply
                make all
The executables are separated in two groups - one for testing the linear
equation routines (linsingle, lindouble, lincomplex, lindcomplex) and
another for testing the eigenvalue problem routines (eigsingle, eigdouble,
eigcomplex, eigdcomplex).

   The make.inc file at the LAPACK95 directory should be adjusted for
the particular environment. Note, that LAPACK95 testing needs library
testlib.a which contains all the testing routines from LAPACK. To produce
this library you need to have access to LAPACK/TESTING directory.
The variable LAPACK_PATH in the make.inc file should give the LAPACK 
directory path. For example, if the LAPACK directory is /usr/local/lib/LAPACK3/
the make.inc should include the following line:

LAPACK_PATH = /usr/local/lib/LAPACK3

   To start a test you should supply an input file. There is a directory,
called INFILES, containing all the input files, that you might need to run
the testings. They are the same files, that LAPACK uses to run LAPACK
testings. In the next few lines there is a short description of the target 
for these input files.
   There are four groups of files : 
     = for single real version of the testings. They usually start with
letter "s", excluding glm.in, gsv.in, lse.in.
   sed.in - (input file for eigsingle) - runs error and computational tests
for  SGEES, SGEEV, SGEESX, SGEEVX
   sgd.in - (eigsingle) - SGGES, SGGEV, SGGESX, SGGEVX
   sgg.in - (eigsingle) - SGEGS, SGEGV
   ssb.in - (eigsingle) - SSBEV, SSBEVD, SSBEVX
   ssg.in - (eigsingle) - SSYGV, SSYGVD, SSYGVX, SSPGV, SSPGVD, SSPGVX,
                          SSBGV, SSBGVD, SSBGVX
   svd.in- (eigsingle)  - SGESVD, SGESDD
   stest.in - (single)  - SGETRF, SGETRI, SGETRS, SGERFS, SGECON, SGESV,
SGESVX, SGEEQU, SGBSV, SGBSVX, SGTSV, SGTSVX, SPOSV, SPOSVX, SPPSV, SPPSVX,
SPBSV, SPBSVX, SPTSV, SPTSVX, SSYSV, SSYSVX, SSPSV, SSPSVX, SGELS, SGELSS,
SGELSX, SGELSY, SGELSD
   glm.in - (eigsingle) - SGGGLM
   gsv.in - (eigsingle) - SGGSVD
   lse.in - (eigsingle) - SGGLSE
   sep.in - (eigsingle) - SSTEV, SSTEVD, SSTEVX, SSTEVR, SSYEV, SSYEVD,
SSYEVX, SSYEVR, SSPEV, SSPEVD, SSPEVX, SSBEV, SSBEVD, SSBEVX
   
      = starting with "c" - for single complex version
      = starting with "d" - for double real version
      = starting with "z" - for double complex version
   The input files  glm.in, gsv.in, lse.in and sep.in are common for all 
four data types.  
   
   An example of running a testing routine is:
   
   ./eigcomplex < INFILES/cgg.in
