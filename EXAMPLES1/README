! --------------  LAPACK95/EXAMPLES1 directory  -----------------------

  This directory contains Fortran95 programs by which were obtained
the results in the LAPACK95 Users' Guide. There are here: 1) Fortran
example main programs with the same name as in the LAPACK95 Users'
Guide, but in lower case letters, 2) the input data for the example
programs if necessary (the input data are automatically read in by the
example programs), 3) the makefile by which an executable program can
be generated, 4) a script file "go = make clean; make la_$1_example;
la_$1_example" and 5) this README file.

  Before running the example programs one must
    1. verify the compiler options and library names "OPTS0",
       "MODLIB", "LAPACK77", "BLAS" and "SUF" in the make.inc file
       at the LAPACK95 directory (LAPACK version 3 or higher should
       be linked with this LAPACK95 version).
    2. generate the LAPACK95 library, go to SRC directory (README
       file)
    3. run example programs. For example,
          
           make la_gesv_example

  This "make" statement will compile the example Fortran program

                  la_gesv_example.f90,

link with the necessary libraries

                  lapack95.a, lapack.a and blas.a,

and generate the executable program

                  la_gesv_example

  One has to run this executable program now. All programs run in
single precision.

                   ./la_gesv_example

  The script should be run as follows

           go gesv

It compiles the Fortran95 example program, links and runs the
executable program.
