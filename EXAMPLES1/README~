! --------------  LAPACK90/EXAMPLE1 directory  ---------------------

  This directory contains Fortran95 programs by which where obtained
the results in the LAPACK95 Users' Guide. There are here: 1) the
example fortran main programs with the same name as in the LAPACK95
Users' Guide, but in lower case letters, 2) the input data for the
example programs if necessary (the input data are automaticaly read
by the example program), 3) the makefile by each an exacutable program
can be generated and 4) this README file.

  Before running the example programs one must
     1. generate the LAPACK95 library, go to SRC directory (README file)
     2. verify the statements "FC90", "FFLAGS" and "LIBS" in the makefile.
     3. verify one example program:
          
                   make la_gesv_example

This statement will compile the example fortran program
                  la_gesv_example.f90
link with the necessary libraries, and generate the executable program
                  la_gesv_example
One has to run this iexecutable program

                   ./la_gesv_example                  

  If the results are much the LAPACK95 Users' Gude results one can run more
examples.
