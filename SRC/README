! --------------  LAPACK95/SRC directory  -----------------------

  This directory contains Fortran95 subroutines of the LAPACK95
library and the Fortran95 generic interface blocks of all LAPACK
driver and computational routines, and the Fortran95 generic interface
blocks of all LAPACK95 routines. Every
LAPACK95 driver subroutine has all needed precision and arithmetic
versions; single precision, double precision, complex and double
complex. There are several versions of Fortran95 generic interface
blocks. Every combination of the library needs different Fortran95
interface block (see below). There are here: 1) LAPACK95 library
routines (auxiliary and user callable). 2) Fortran95 generic
interface
blocks for LAPACK driver and computational routines are:
f77_lapack_single.f90 -- for single precision library,
f77_lapack_double.f90 -- for double precision library,
f77_lapack_single_complex.f90 -- for single precision and complex
library, f77_lapack_single_double.f90 -- for single and double
precisions library, f77_lapack_double_dcomplex.f90 -- for double
precision and double complex library,
f77_lapack_single_double_complex.f90 -- for single and double
precision, and complex library,
f77_lapack_single_double_complex_dcomplex.f90 -- for single and double
precision, complex and double complex library 3) Fortran95 generic
interface blocks for LAPACK5 auxiliary routines (this module is needed
for every library version): la_auxmod.f90 -- for LAPACK95 auxiliary
routines. 4) Fortran95 generic interface blocks for LAPACK5 driver
routines are: f95_lapack_single.f90 -- for single precision library,
f95_lapack_double.f90 -- for double precision library,
f95_lapack_single_complex.f90 -- for single precision and complex
library, f95_lapack_single_double.f90 -- for single and double
precisions library, f95_lapack_double_dcomplex.f90 -- for double
precision and double complex library,
f95_lapack_single_double_complex.f90 -- for single and double
precision, and complex library,
f95_lapack_single_double_complex_dcomplex.f90 -- for single and double
precision, complex and double complex library. 5) The makefile by
which the LAPACK95 library can be generated. And 6) this README file.

  The compiler and libraries options "OPTS0", "MODLIB", "LAPACK77",
"BLAS" and "SUF" in the make.inc file at the LAPACK95 directory should
be verified before starting to generate the LAPACK95 library.

  The makefile should be executed as follows:

    make single # for single precision library,
    make double # for double precision library,
    make single_complex # for single precision and complex library,
    make single_double # for single and double precisions library,
    make double_dcomplex # for double precision and double complex
                           library,
    make single_double_complex # for single and double precision, and
                                 complex library,
    make single_double_complex_dcomplex # for single and double
                                          precision, complex and
                                          double complex library.

  If the control of the program fails during the makefile execution do

    make clean

  before generating the next time the library.
